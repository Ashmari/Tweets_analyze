"[NLU] The user is expressing their opinion about nuclear power plants, questioning the need for them. They mention that there is enough electricity due to the efforts of Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO) and the conservation of the citizens. They suggest that if this continues, there would be no need for nuclear power plants. Additionally, they hint that nuclear power plants may be profitable compared to other forms of power generation. 

[TUL] We no longer need nuclear power plants because we have enough electricity, thanks to TEPCO's efforts and the energy conservation by the public. If we continue in this way, there would be no need for nuclear power plants. Perhaps, the only reason nuclear power plants are preferred is because they are more profitable compared to other forms of power generation."

That being said, it's comfortable, but it's disappointing that the input time isn't dramatically shortened. Since it's a mini keyboard, you can't input using all fingers, and you can only use your thumbs to type like a PlayStation controller.

Parents are just like children, unable to tolerate being retweeted. When I observe Arabian child-rearing, there are no scenes where they make their children "endure". If the child wants something while shopping at a supermarket, they will let them eat or drink even before paying. They cut ahead in lines without waiting. They don't make them wear seat belts if they don't want to. They give them cola to drink from the time they start using a bottle, just because they want it.
[TARGET] It seems that the matter regarding Master Tanshi was true after all. It is disappointing because I used to listen to his rakugo CDs when I was a student.

I couldn't sleep well, so I went shopping earlier. It's a good thing today is like a relay race. There might be more road closures and the like.
I recently thought about why I've become obsessed with home roasting coffee. I've been involved in manufacturing for years, but with coffee roasting, I can personally choose the raw materials, purchase them, inspect them, process them, prepare for production, tailor the production to my taste, and finally, evaluate and enjoy it as a customer myself. It's quite interesting, don't you think? Cooking is similar, too.

[ASSISTANT] It's okay, that's just how I am... (laughs) I'm sorry.
(At McDonald's Nara Family Store) [URL] I wonder who is nearby? I don't want to get involved.
It seems that business is bad. Is this what happens when a movie has been playing for over a month in a local cinema?
Long time no see ♥ Kaori. So, Kaori, what about the iPhone plan? lol [USER] [USER]
[USER] Nervous, huh? What's there to be nervous about now… We're already close, aren't we? Hahaha.

I will be returning to work as a manager at a welfare company in Toyama (my hometown) starting from April! (*_*)
Today, there were 2 cancellations and 1 no-show (T . T) No-show means cancelling without notice. As an adult, it's very disappointing. It's surprising how common it is... •••.
[USER] If you have free time, come and visit the Uniqlo on the 13th floor of Umeda Hankyu Department Store! lol
By bicycle.
I bought a birthday present for my mother and father~ (o^^o) It's not a bad idea to go out with sisters occasionally.
It's cold, right? Even Mom says it's cold on her trip to Okinawa starting today! Haha. Can't wait to see you tomorrow! I'm excited! I've also prepared the souvenirs perfectly! [URL]
Returning from a business trip to Tokyo, I arrived at Takamatsu Airport. In addition to the Sanuki Udon replica on the turntable, there were also Olive Beef and Yellowtail replicas. [URL]
Having tea at grandma's house. Even though it's the same tea as at home, it feels somehow different. Cozy.
This is Tokyo Station. The Shinkansen (bullet train) is quite crowded. Perhaps it's because it's Monday. Let's make sure to double-check the accuracy of the location information display.
I got mad at my husband (T^T), but it's his fault! It's going to take a long time for me to become as patient as a Buddha (/ _ ; )
[USER] I thought BaiSoNya of Kirin this (laughs) Thank you very much ^^ Senpai, you've worked hard searching for headphones (^q^) (laughs)

It's better to distance yourself from people you don't like. Because gradually, you will become more and more like that person, and it will become even more unpleasant. You might even start disliking yourself.
Today is Sakai Kartland, you know. The clouds are looking like it might rain. I don't like rain. [URL]

Congratulations to Nadeshiko Japan for winning! I just found out on Twitter. Gonna turn on the TV and watch the highlights. ♬
Lately, I keep cutting my fingers a lot... You know, with cardboard and paper and stuff. It really hurts, you knowww.
Over the past year, I have devoted a considerable amount of time to launching a project. I have come to realize that I can have candid discussions about business concerns and issues with my colleagues with whom I have had ongoing discussions. These colleagues are a valuable asset.

Moreover, you don't really do much preparation beforehand when it comes to researching the local area during the journey, do you?
I feel like I've heard of a place called "Otoh no Mori"! But since I still have time, I'll do some research (^○^) "[USER] [USER] [USER] There are so many pensions to choose from, it's confusing! I still don't know where the venue is (´･ω･`)"

[USER] It was your birthday! Congratulations～(´∀｀*) It must be something quite important♪
The movie I saw yesterday, "One Life" produced by BBC, had stunning visuals. I was amazed at how they captured scenes of mice escaping from lizards and filming lizards walking on water surfaces from underwater. It was heartwarming to see the parents fiercely protecting their children from external threats. It was great to watch it with the family!
When I listened to 尾崎豊's "Oh~my little girl" on YouTube, I felt like crying for no reason (ToT). I used to have a love like this back in the old days ♪

I took a quick peek at Anri Areiji's exhibition. Today, I will be meeting up with a friend from Paris who is temporarily back in Japan, and we are planning to have TKC (Tokyo-style fried chicken) and Jingisukan (Genghis Khan - a type of grilled mutton dish).
The local train bound for Kanazawa, scheduled to depart from Tsubata Station at 16:11, is considerably delayed. However, I feel relieved knowing that it will still connect to the Hakutaka No. 21 at Takaoka Station. Is it difficult to make a connection with the Shinkansen at Echigo-Yuzawa?

Yesterday, I learned about a cultivation game called "Nameko Mushroom" from my fellow "Monster Bride" friends. I downloaded it and all you have to do is cultivate and harvest. It's simple, but somehow the cute and creepy mushrooms start to look adorable, and it's quite intriguing.
I am currently enjoying myself at Ikspiari with my family. "[USER], right now, I'm really into Tashu sake and fresh oysters from Akkeshi. They're so delicious!" "[USER], they look delicious! "First, I'll start with marinated mackerel and a bottle of beer. Thank you for your hard work in this hot weather today..."
So, next week's "Ametalk" will feature Hana Daigekijin comedians! I'm looking forward to it! (*^^*)

I'm boarding a flight to Fukuoka right now ( ; ; ) Had a great time in Okinawa ~(>_<)
Actually, there's another episode. The only thing I wanted to eat was something hot, so I asked to let it cool down and went to the bedroom. Of course, I couldn't cool it down because I was watching Luna. I ended up just falling asleep like that. It's not like I accepted it or anything, it just felt like I was going with the flow.

I went to about 4-5 stores looking for a Monstera, but they weren't selling it anywhere. Is it really that popular? Well, I guess I should consider changing my plans... (´Д｀)Ã%7
