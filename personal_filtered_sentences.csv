"I underestimated the crowds at the evening festival... The usually empty restaurant was suddenly bustling with people, and after working overtime for three hours, I finally made it home.

Then, a group of yakuza men approached me and asked, ""Did you go to the evening festival? Want some beer?"" I casually declined, saying that I couldn't drink... By the way, don't you think that sweet and sour pork is delicious?"

I forgot to eat lunch (--;) and ended up eating tonkatsu even though I'm on a diet.
"Mayor Hashimoto's way of thinking is very clear and easy to empathize with. Since 3.11, I have become aware of the naivety of blindly believing in something. As an adult responsibility, I will start by signing the petition for a national referendum on ""nuclear power"" as a first step that I can do."
